            <h2>ðŸ‘‹ Hello world! I'm Lance.</h2>
            <p>
                Welcome to my portfolio website! Explore my page to learn a little bit about me, my personal projects, and the resources I have used to study AI.
                <br><br>
                And if you have spare time, please take a moment to read my own anecdote that Iâ€™d like to share about my reason for pursuing AI and the vision I have for the field:

                Growing up in Silicon Valley, I was always surrounded by tech. Having 3 older brothers also gave me an early introduction to gaming: 
                I played my first game, Counter Strike, at the age of 7 (would not advise this for children). 
                Since then, Iâ€™ve played various [competitive] games, from console to PC, which has taught me to think critically and fast at a young age. 
                I was also fortunate enough to live in a time when floppy disks were still around, and in junior high school, 
                I took a computer class that made us practice on early Macintosh computers.
                <br><br>
                Fast forward to today, the hottest topic in tech right now is AI, which has arguably been as revolutionary as when the internet was first introduced. 
                Playing around with ChatGPT, I quickly saw its potential, how powerful it was and how powerful it can become. I was inspired. 
                I immediately took this opportunity to pursue software development in AI, and Iâ€™ve taken advantage of its capabilities to accelerate my learning about the magical world of programming.
                <br><br>
                My reason for pursuing AI is because of the limitless and intrinsic capabilities of neural networks. 
                The randomness is what excites me; you never really know what to expect when you use any AI product. 
                I also believe that advancing AI should be the ultimate goal of software development (space science would be a close first), 
                and the idea of achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI) is much more fascinating to me than any other subfield in technology. 
                And if I want to master my craft at something in this field, then I want to aim for the best. To me, that is knowing how to integrate AI into products.
                <br><br>
                On that note, I think AI can be integrated into almost every industry, if not all. 
                My hope for the field is that more and more AI products will be created so that it is as convenient and usable as the internet itself. 
                I would love for AI to have a big impact especially in healthcare since a lot of health technologies are still so outdated, and health is one of my top priorities. 
                In the near future, we might just have a whole new AI-powered operating system for everyone to use. Whatever it is, Iâ€™m on a mission to contribute and be a part of this AI revolution.
