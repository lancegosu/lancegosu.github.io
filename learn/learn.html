            <h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAqhIrjkxbuWI23v9cThsA9GvCAUhRvKZ" target="_blank">Andrej Karpathy's Neural Networks: Zero to Hero series on YouTube</a></h3>
            <p>
                Andrej Karpathy's lectures provides an insightful journey through the evolution of language modeling, 
                specifically focusing on the transition to the transformer model. 
                Across eight videos, he delves into the fundamentals of neural networks and backpropagation, 
                constructing a language model (makemore) with emphasis on components like MLP, activations, gradients, and BatchNorm. 
                The series culminates in the creation of a WaveNet and a comprehensive walkthrough on building GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) from scratch, 
                offering an in-depth exploration of the state of GPT. Karpathy's engaging presentations demystify the complexities, 
                making it an invaluable resource for understanding the intricacies of modern language models.
